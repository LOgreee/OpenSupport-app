## 💡 About

**OpenSupport** is an all-in-one web application for customer support and ticket management. Built without heavy frameworks or unnecessary third-party bloat, it provides a comprehensive dashboard for support agents along with an intuitive, clean interface for clients.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 💬 **Live Chat & File Sharing**: Engage in real-time conversations on tickets, securely request and receive attachments (.png, .jpg, .mp4, .pdf), and insert pre-defined canned responses.
- 📝 **Visual Form Builder**: Create tailor-made collection fields for each team (text, email, telephone, select dropdown, checkbox).
- 🔀 **Conditional Auto-Routing**: Automatically route inbound tickets to a designated agent or group based on user-selected dropdown answers.
- 🏢 **Multi-Team & Staff Roles**: Keep team tickets separated, assign job titles, define agent groups, and manage out-of-office periods to bypass auto-assignment.
- 📊 **Analytics & Feedback**: Track average resolution times, monitor monthly volume per agent, and collect post-resolution customer satisfaction scores.
- 🔌 **REST API v1 & iFrame Embeds**: Embed responsive support forms on external websites via customizable iFrames or automate workflows using Bearer-authenticated endpoints.
- 🌍 **Native Internationalization (i18n)**: Out-of-the-box support for French, English, and Spanish with persistent session language settings.
